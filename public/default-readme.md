# Welcome to [codeCityName] 

## Overview

This is your code city visualization! You're currently exploring a repository as an interactive 2D cityscape where:

- **Buildings** represent files and directories
- **Height** indicates file complexity or size
- **Colors** represent different programming languages
- **Districts** organize code by functionality

## Getting Started

### Navigation
- **Mouse**: Click and drag to rotate the camera
- **Wheel**: Zoom in and out
- **Click**: Select buildings to explore

### Understanding Your City

#### Building Types
- 🏢 **Tall Buildings**: Complex files with many functions
- 🏠 **Small Buildings**: Simple files or configuration
- 🏭 **Industrial**: Build files, configs, and tooling
- 🌳 **Parks**: Documentation and README files

#### Color Coding
- 🔵 **Blue**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- 🟢 **Green**: Python
- 🔴 **Red**: Java/C++
- 🟡 **Yellow**: CSS/HTML
- 🟣 **Purple**: Configuration files

## Features

### Pull Request Visualization
When exploring pull requests, you'll see:
- **Highlighted buildings** for changed files
- **Construction zones** for new files
- **Renovation indicators** for modified files
- **Demolition sites** for deleted files

### Interactive Elements
- Click on buildings to see file details
- Explore different layers of your codebase
- Navigate through time with pull request changes

## Tips for Exploration

1. **Start with the overview** - Get familiar with the city layout
2. **Look for patterns** - Similar colored districts often work together
3. **Find the heart** - Core files are usually in the city center
4. **Check the suburbs** - Tests and documentation live on the edges

## About Code Cities

Code cities are a powerful way to understand software architecture through spatial visualization. This approach helps developers:

- **Identify complexity hotspots**
- **Understand code organization**
- **Visualize technical debt**
- **Plan refactoring efforts**
