Welcome to Principal ADE - your AI-powered development environment designed to make engineering teams more productive.

## What is Principal ADE?

Principal ADE is a revolutionary development environment that combines the power of AI agents with traditional development tools. Our mission is to help engineering teams:

- **Design and Share** - Store all information in git repositories, no login or subscription necessary
- **Manage Agents** - Bring whatever agent you use and manage them from one unified interface
- **Access All Projects** - Browse and explore the structure of all your projects
- **Maintain Engineering Context** - Keep context across all your repositories

## Key Features

### 1. Git-Native Storage

We store everything in your git repositories using [a24z-memory](https://github.com/a24z-ai/core-library). This means:

- No vendor lock-in
- Team collaboration is built-in
- Version control for everything
- Works offline

### 2. Beautiful Markdown Rendering

Agents write a lot of markdown - it should be easy to read. We've built customizable themes that allow you to read docs the way you want.

### 3. Unified Agent Management

Whether you're using local or remote agents, Principal ADE provides one place to manage them all. Copy and paste tasks, track progress, and maintain context across different AI assistants.
